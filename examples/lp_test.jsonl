{"sent": "Chapter 4 .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I had thus learned a second fact of great importance : this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house !", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But that did not really surprise me much .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I knew very well that in addition to the great planets -- such as the Earth , Jupiter , Mars , Venus -- to which we have given names , there are also hundreds of others , some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name , but only a number .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "He might call it , for example , \" Asteroid 325 . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612 .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "That was by a Turkish astronomer , in 1909 .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "On making his discovery , the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress , in a great demonstration .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But he was in Turkish costume , and so nobody would believe what he said .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Grown - ups are like that ...", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Fortunately , however , for the reputation of Asteroid B-612 , a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects , under pain of death , should change to European costume .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again , dressed with impressive style and elegance .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And this time everybody accepted his report .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "If I have told you these details about the asteroid , and made a note of its number for you , it is on account of the grown - ups and their ways .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "WHen you tell them that you have made a new friend , they never ask you any questions about essential matters .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "They never say to you , \" What does his voice sound like ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "What games does he love best ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Does he collect butterflies ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Instead , they demand : \" How old is he ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "How many brothers has he ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "How much does he weigh ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "How much money does his father make ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "If you were to say to the grown - ups : \" I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick , with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof , \" they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "You would have to say to them : \" I saw a house that cost $ 20,000 . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Then they would exclaim : \" Oh , what a pretty house that is ! \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Just so , you might say to them : \" The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming , that he laughed , and that he was looking for a sheep .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "If anybody wants a sheep , that is a proof that he exists . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And what good would it do to tell them that ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "They would shrug their shoulders , and treat you like a child .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But if you said to them : \" The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612 , \" then they would be convinced , and leave you in peace from their questions .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "They are like that .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "One must not hold it against them .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Children should always show great forbearance toward grown - up people .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But certainly , for us who understand life , figures are a matter of indifference .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy - tales .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I should have like to say : \" Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself , and who had need of a sheep ... \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "To those who understand life , that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me , with his sheep .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "If I try to describe him here , it is to make sure that I shall not forget him .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "To forget a friend is sad .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Not every one has had a friend .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And if I forget him , I may become like the grown - ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures ...", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "It is for that purpose , again , that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "It is hard to take up drawing again at my age , when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside , since I was six .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But I am not at all sure of success .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "One drawing goes along all right , and another has no resemblance to its subject .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I make some errors , too , in the little prince 's height : in one place he is too tall and in another too short .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "So I fumble along as best I can , now good , now bad , and I hope generally fair - to - middling .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "In certain more important details I shall make mistakes , also .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But that is something that will not be my fault .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "My friend never explained anything to me .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "He thought , perhaps , that I was like himself .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But I , alas , do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Perhaps I am a little like the grown - ups .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I have had to grow old .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Chapter 5 .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "As each day passed I would learn , in our talk , something about the little prince 's planet , his departure from it , his journey .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "The information would come very slowly , as it might chance to fall from his thoughts .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "It was in this way that I heard , on the third day , about the catastrophe of the baobabs .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "This time , once more , I had the sheep to thank for it .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "For the little prince asked me abruptly -- as if seized by a grave doubt -- \" It is true , is n't it , that sheep eat little bushes ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" Yes , that is true . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" Ah !", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I am glad ! \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But the little prince added : \" Then it follows that they also eat baobabs ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes , but , on the contrary , trees as big as castles ; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him , the herd would not eat up one single baobab .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" We would have to put them one on top of the other , \" he said .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But he made a wise comment : \" Before they grow so big , the baobabs start out by being little . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" That is strictly correct , \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I said .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "He answered me at once , \" Oh , come , come ! \" , as if he were speaking of something that was self - evident .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem , without any assistance .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Indeed , as I learned , there were on the planet where the little prince lived -- as on all planets -- good plants and bad plants .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "In consequence , there were good seeds from good plants , and bad seeds from bad plants .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But seeds are invisible .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "They sleep deep in the heart of the earth 's darkness , until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin -- timidly at first -- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose - bush , one would let it grow wherever it might wish .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But when it is a bad plant , one must destroy it as soon as possible , the very first instant that one recognizes it .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince ; and these were the seeds of the baobab .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "The soil of that planet was infested with them .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "A baobab is something you will never , never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "It spreads over the entire planet .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "It bores clear through it with its roots .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And if the planet is too small , and the baobabs are too many , they split it in pieces ...", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" It is a question of discipline , \" the little prince said to me later on .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" When you 've finished your own toilet in the morning , then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet , just so , with the greatest care .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs , at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "It is very tedious work , \" the little prince added , \" but very easy . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And one day he said to me : \" You ought to make a beautiful drawing , so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Sometimes , \" he added , \" there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But when it is a matter of baobabs , that always means a catastrophe .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "He neglected three little bushes ... \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "So , as the little prince described it to me , I have made a drawing of that planet .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood , and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid , that for once I am breaking through my reserve .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" Children , \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I say plainly , \" watch out for the baobabs ! \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "My friends , like myself , have been skirting this danger for a long time , without ever knowing it ; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Perhaps you will ask me , \" Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "The reply is simple .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I have tried .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But with the others I have not been successful .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Chapter 6 .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Oh , little prince !", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life ...", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day , when you said to me : \" I am very fond of sunsets .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Come , let us go look at a sunset now . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" But we must wait , \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I said .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" Wait ?", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "For what ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" For the sunset .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "We must wait until it is time . \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "At first you seemed to be very much surprised .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And then you laughed to yourself .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "You said to me : \" I am always thinking that I am at home ! \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Just so .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "If you could fly to France in one minute , you could go straight into the sunset , right from noon .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "Unfortunately , France is too far away for that .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But on your tiny planet , my little prince , all you need do is move your chair a few steps .", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like ...", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" One day , \" you said to me , \" I saw the sunset forty - four times ! \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "And a little later you added : \" You know -- one loves the sunset , when one is so sad ... \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "\" Were you so sad , then ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "I asked , \" on the day of the forty - four sunsets ? \"", "amr": ""}
{"sent": "But the little prince made no reply .", "amr": ""}
